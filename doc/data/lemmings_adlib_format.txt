adlib.dat file format

To read adlib.dat, you first have to decompress it using the .dat file decompression.
You should end up with just one decompressed section.

The decompressed adlib.dat section begins with x86 machine code to handle an interrupt.
Therefore, in order to play sound from adlib.dat, DOS Lemmings decompresses adlib.dat
into memory and adds an interrupt handler pointing to position 0x0000 of the
decompressed data. Then the sound is played by calling this interrupt with
parameter in the ax register.
The parameter handling works as follows:

switch (ah) {
	case 0x00:
		continue playing current sound;
		return;
	case 0x01:
		initialize adlib;
		return;
	case 0x02:
		stop playing current sound;
		return;
	case 0x03:
		load music title specified in al register;
		return;
	case 0x04:
		load sound specified in al register;
		return;
	case 0x05:
		some unknown action;
		return;
	default:
		return;
}

Because 16it DOS Lemmings cannot use multitasking,
the action "continue playing current sound" has to be called
constantly while sound or music plays.
This action triggers some adlib hardware interrupts corresponding
to the current position inside the sound or music and returns.
It cannot play the whole song, because the control flow must
return to the game in order to do all the other things like
animating lemmings.
