Place multiplayer level from Oh No! More Lemmings game here.
You may find these files in an old version of Lix (before 2015) - or somewhere else.
File names must be 01.lvl to 10.lvl.
Note that the order must not be changed, because otherwise
the green goals may count for the blue player and vice versa!
