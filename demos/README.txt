The games in this folder were released as free demo versions.
However, they are protected by copyright law, so they must not be modified,
and the graphics, sound, and levels must not be included in other software.

Therefore, the games are in this separate folder and not in the
xmas91 and xmas92 folders of the main project.

You can play the demos using DOSBox.
