# Lemmings for 3DS

Setup:
Copy the required files into the folders
orig, ohno, xmas91, xmas92, holi93, and/or holi94.
See README.txt in these folders.
These files are not included (and will never be included),
because they are protected by copyright law.

For game control, see the file named CONTROL.txt.

Sound is not supported yet.
The source code is not released yet, because it needs to be cleaned before.
Sorry for these limitations.
