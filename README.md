# Lemmings for 3DS

Setup:
Copy the required* files into the following subfolders of /lemmings folder:
orig\_demo, orig, ohno\_demo, ohno, xmas91, xmas92, holi93\_demo, holi93, holi94\_demo and/or holi94. You need to fill at least one folder to play the game.
To avoid duplicates, you may only fill these folders if you own all Lemmings games:

\* See README.txt in these folders.

These files are not included (and will never be included),

Sound is not supported yet. Sorry for this limitation.
