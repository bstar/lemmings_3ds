# Lemmings for 3DS

Setup:
Create a folder called lemmings either on the root of the SD card or in the 3ds folder.
Copy the required* files into the following subfolders of lemmings folder:
orig\_demo, orig, ohno\_demo, ohno, xmas91, xmas92, holi93\_demo, holi93, holi94\_demo and/or holi94. You need to fill at least one folder to play the game.
To avoid duplicates, you may only fill these folders if you own all Lemmings games:
orig, ohno, xmas91, xmas92, holi94
For multiplayer mode, fill the subfolders of /lemmings/2p of the host system.

If you modify level files later, you should delete the CACHE_xx.DAT files in the lemmings folder afterwards.

The game uses the NDSP service to play audio. Thus you need a DSP firm dump to have audio.
You may want to use your own sound and/or music files.
Put your wave files into lemmings/audio folder.
See README.txt in that folder for more details.

These files are not included (and will never be included),
because they are protected by copyright law.

For game control, see CONTROL.txt.

\* See README.txt in these folders.
